# Game Instructions

## Overview
The game is a tile-based challenge where players need to press tiles to reduce their value until they disappear. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible before the game ends.

## Game Setup
- The game grid consists of a 4x4 layout.
- Initially, there are 10 random tiles with values ranging from 1 to 5.

## How to Play
1. **Press a Tile**: Tap on any tile to decrease its value by 1.
2. **Tile Value**: If the tile's value becomes 0 after your press, it will disappear from the grid.
3. **Score**: Each time a tile disappears, your score increases by 1.

## Game Over
- The game ends when the number of tiles on the grid reaches 16 (the maximum capacity of the grid).
- An alert will display your final score.

## Resetting the Game
- After the game is over, you can restart by pressing the reset button, which will generate a new set of tiles and reset your score to 0.

## Animations
- When a tile is pressed and disappears, an animation will play to indicate the action, providing visual feedback to the player.

## Objective
- The objective is to clear as many tiles as possible and achieve the highest score before the game ends.
